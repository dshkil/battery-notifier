<string name="about_message">Battery Notifier (Big Text) is a status bar modification to Dmytro Shkil\'s open source app Battery Notifier.
It replaces the battery icons and optional small battery value text with big, easy to read, colored text while retaining all of the battery charge 
level notification features of Battery Notifier.\r\n\r\nSTATUS BAR TEXT COLORS:\r\nThe text color is based on the current battery 
charge value and breaks down as follows:\r\nGreen: 50-100\r\nBlue: 30-49\r\nOrange: 15-29\r\nRed: 0-14\r\n\r\nWhen the battery is fully 
charged, the fully charged battery icon will appear. After the device is unplugged, 100 in green text will appear.\r\n\r\nThe specific 
colors chosen were selected and tested to be easy to read whether one has a black, white or gray status bar.&#160;&#160;
The decision was made to offer only these color options in order to keep the app small and fast.\r\n\r\nThanks mainly to Dmitry\'s work,
and his generosity in making his app open source, I believe this mod now has one of the easiest to read battery status bar indicators of 
ANY app, that at the same time puts as little strain on your battery as possible.\r\n\r\nlarryvgs\r\n\r\n\r\nDmytro Shkyl\'s original 
Battery Notifier can be found at the Android Market if you prefer the original battery icons and text.
